# tree-sitter-cel

> WIP tree-sitter grammar for cel

[cel spec](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md)

## why?

Learn about tree-sitter and possibly use [the generated parser](https://matklad.github.io/2023/05/21/resilient-ll-parsing-tutorial.html) as the basis of a language server for cel.
